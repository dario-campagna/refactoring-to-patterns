# Refactoring to Patterns Examples

This repositories shows the example code of two refactorings from the book [Refactoring to Patterns](https://industriallogic.com/xp/refactoring/).


The first refactoring is *Replace Implicit Tree with Composite*, described in Chapter 7.
The tag `replace-implicit-tree-with-composite` points to the initial state of the code with the implicit tree.
The commits after the tag (more or less) correspond to the steps to apply the refactoring described in the chapter.   

The second refactoring is *Encapsulate Composite with Builder*, described in Chapter 8.
The tag `encapsulate-composite-with-builder` points to the initial state of the code with the Composite.
The commits after the tag (more or less) correspond to the steps to apply the refactoring described in the chapter.

Both refactorings use a test-driven approach.
